######### This is how I get the info from a txt file that I pass with the running of the script
entity_demands = {}
#### entity_demands will be my inputs in the form of a dict

script, file = argv
input_file = open(file)
## .readlines() will produce a list (array) of variables of the entire file with each line being an object in the list
## this make it perfect to iterate over with for loops
## .readline() is different and only reads a character at a time
## .xreadlines() will read one line at a time, therefore use this with really big file where I don't want to eat up memory
## more info  	http://www.peterbe.com/plog/blogitem-040312-1 #########
input_file_demands = input_file.readlines()
for x in input_file_demands:

	## The strip will remove the hidden \n new line, and spaces which would transfer with the value 
	entity_demands[k.strip()] = v.strip()



#### I could have the program execute over the info, and even out then to a file!!
#### This file then can be formatted to have a standard output that will give all the values I need in a nice display


#########Use HTML to get the input from user and to start the python program if possible
########## then at the end of the python program have it output to a file maybe even HTML

########## Need to put code rule for each function great way for me to learn them ###################
