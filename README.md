## These are the projects that I am currently working on or have complete

I would be **very happy** for any suggestions about my scripts. The reason being
is I am very new to all this coding and I am teaching myself, with no other help.
Can be frustrating sometimes lol.

Each project will have its own README.md file to try and explain my thought 
process and why I choose to do the things that I did.

#### How to Run
###### Info about script
These projects are all python programs that has been written for python v3.3
As I have just started to learn I felt it was best to learn the newest version, 
even though I have done a ton of reading about why most people are avoiding the 
switch. However, I don't have module dependences so... lol

All the scripts are very simple and are just run from the command line by simply

>python -3 *script*

the python -3 is just how powershell runs python v3 for me, your may differ
 
The electrical project script require the respective .txt file as the second 
argument.
